1. Why Data?
2. Different Areas of Data
3. Data Types
    Boolean: a binary variable, having two possible values TRUE or FALSE
    Numeric: a variable expressed explicitly as a number -infinity through infinity.
             this can be expressed as an INT (a whole number) or a FLOAT (a decimal)
    Categorical: a variable represented through a number representing a category.
             this number cannot be used in numeric analysis.
    String: a variable stored as simple text.
            often these are narrative variables or variables joined to categoricals describing those categories.
